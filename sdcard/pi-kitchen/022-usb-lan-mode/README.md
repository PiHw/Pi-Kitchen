#USB Device Mode - LAN#
The Raspberry Pi Model A and Raspberry Pi Zero have the ability to be setup as USB devices (since they are wired directly to the Broadcom processor).  This recipe sets up the Raspberry Pi as a Virtual USB LAN Device.

This recipe is based on the hard work of Andrew Mulholland (@gbaman1), DaveB (PiForums) and LadyAda (AdaFruit).

The Adafruit guide ([https://learn.adafruit.com/turning-your-raspberry-pi-zero-into-a-usb-gadget?view=all](https://learn.adafruit.com/turning-your-raspberry-pi-zero-into-a-usb-gadget?view=all "Raspberry Pi USB Device Mode")) explains the process.

##020-usb-device-module recipe##
The general process is as follows:

1. Get gadgetkernel.tgz module (http://adafruit-download.s3.amazonaws.com/gadgetmodulekernel_151226a.tgz).
2. Uncompress the kernel module (`tar -xvzf gadgetkernel.tgz`).
3. Backup the current kernel.img (`sudo mv /boot/kernel.img /boot/kernelbackup.img`)
4. Replace the boot `kernel.img` (`sudo mv tmp/boot/kernel.img /boot`).
5. Install Overlays and Modules.<pre>
sudo mv tmp/boot/overlays/* /boot/overlays
sudo mv tmp/boot/*dtb /boot
sudo cp -R tmp/boot/modules/lib/* /lib
</pre>

##022-usb-lan-mode recipe##
1. Update the module (Add `g_ether` to `etc/modules`).
2. Add the following to `/etc/network/interfaces`:
3. <pre>allow-hotplug usb0
iface usb0 inet static
        address 192.168.42.2
        netmask 255.255.255.0
        network 192.168.42.0
        broadcast 192.168.42.255
        gateway 192.168.42.1</pre>

On restart the Raspberry Pi should be detected (by the connected computer) as a Ethernet device.

On the host machine, setup the ethernet connection with the following manual settings:

- IP Address: 192.168.42.1
- Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
- Default Gateway: 192.168.42.1
- No DNS.

###Using network hostnames###
Alternatively (instead of putting a fixed IP) install **Bonjour** on Windows (already included on Apple Mac) which will allow us to use the Raspberry Pi hostname `raspberry.local`.

On Pi you may need (probably already installed):

`sudo apt-get install avahi-daemon`

For MAC support you may also need:

`sudo apt-get install netatalk`

On Windows either install iTunes (which includes it) or Bonjour Print Services for Windows 2.0.2 ([http://support.apple.com/kb/DL999](http://support.apple.com/kb/DL999 "Bonjour Print Services for Windows 2.0.2."))

###Sharing the host computer internet connection###
Connect the Raspberry Pi and 
On the host PC, enable ICS (Internet Connection Sharing), as follows:

On windows, this is achieved via the **Control Panel > Network and Internet > Network Connections** window.


- Right click on the network adaptor from which you normally connect to the internet (i.e. Wifi) and select **properties**.
- Enable **Internet Connection Sharing** on the **Sharing**.
- Select the Ethernet device which 
- Take note of the IP address suggested, but don't accept it yet!  i.e. Suggested IP address: 192.168.137.1

Connect to the Raspberry Pi via Putty using the previously configured IP address (192.168.42.2).

- You must set the Raspberry Pi's IP address to match the first three numbers, by editing `/etc/network/interfaces` (you can update your recipe file if you wish so this address is always used):

        address 192.168.137.2
        netmask 255.255.255.0
        network 192.168.137.0
        broadcast 192.168.137.255
        gateway 192.168.137.1
- Reboot the Raspberry Pi using `sudo reboot`
- Finally, enable ICS and accept the suggested IP address (you should be able to connect using the newly set address for the Raspberry Pi 192.168.137.2 via Putty).
