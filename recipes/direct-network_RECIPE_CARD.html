<!--<p> Moved description from RECIPE_CARD.txt to README.md file-->
This recipe places the direct network connection scripts on to the SD-Card.<p>  See <a href="http://pihw.wordpress.com/guides/direct-network-connection/super-easy-direct-network-connection/">Super Easy Direct Network Connection</a>.  <p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PiHw/Pi-Kitchen/master/markdown_source/markdown/img/directconnection.png" width=400 /> <p>The cmdline.txt allows you to specify the IP address of the Raspberry Pi on boot.<p>This allows you to setup an IP address suitable for a direct network link (using a single network cable to a PC or laptop).<p>The resulting connection is just like a normal network so you can share files using SMB and remote connect using SSH, as well as use X-Forwarding to remotely run graphical programs (or use VNC).<p><p>The direct connection IP address is set to 169.254.69.69<p></font>

<font color = GREEN>
pi-kitchen/direct-network<p>
</font>

This recipe uses the following files:<p>
<font color = GREEN>
direct/cmdline.txt<p> normal/cmdline.txt<p> switch.ip<p><p>
</font>

<b>Plus the following files in the _SETTINGS folder:</b><p>

It is assumed that the following file(s) are placed in the following location on the NOOBS RECOVERY partition:<p>
<font color = GREEN>
<code>pi-kitchen/_SETTINGS/direct-network</code><p>
</font>

You will need the following _SETTINGS file(s):<p>

<font color = GREEN>
internet/cmdline.txt<p><p>

<b>NOTE:</b> Files which are configured manually or may contain sensitive information are placed in the _SETTTINGS directory on the SD-Card.  This is so that it is easier to support different configurations and remove sensitive information from the setup if needed.<p>

Perform the following actions:<p>
<font color = GREEN>
Ensure you update cmdline.internet with the PC's IP address as the gateway.<p>
</font>

You can download all the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PiHw/Pi-Kitchen/master/sdcard/pi-kitchen/direct-network/ingredients.zip">ingredient files</a>, and extract directly to the NOOBS SD-Card (ensuring you remove the zipfiles name from the directory - the files should be extracted to <code>/Pi-Kitchen</code>.<p>

<h2>The Recipe Files</h2>
Each recipe will use one file for each of the partitions it installs to - boot, root and data).<p>


You will need to suitably rename or copy the content of each of the following files into your recipe files (i.e. <code>RaspbianPiKitchen_root.txt</code>) and place them in your os folder in the NOOBS partition (i.e. <code>os/Raspbian</code>).<p>
